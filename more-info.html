        BAHEKAR SUPER-SPECIALITY HOSPITAL
        – A Unit Of Gondiacare Hospital
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year 1983, Dr Deepak and Dr Alka Bahekar came to Gondia.
        They joined Government Hospital Gondia, as part of the post graduation
        training. Over the mandatory one-year registrar-ship they developed a
        bond with the people. It grew so strong that they settled in this foreign
        land, making it their very own! The commitment to bring in a change
        drove them to modernise the practice of medicine in this small town.
        In 1985, against all odds the foundation of Bahekar Nursing Home
        was laid. Hard work, passion, kindness and morality - the four
        cornerstones on which the foundation was set. It was started as a 10
        bedded Hospital set up with 2-bedded ICU, an operation theatre and 24 *
        7 dedicated services to the locals. <br> <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dedication, devotion and the
        sincerity in the efforts turned this nursing home into a healthcare hotspot.
        In 1996 to meet rising demands, the hospital was upgraded to a 25-
        bedded setup; bringing quality healthcare to the grass roots.
        Shifting critical patients to the closest tertiary centres in Nagpur, on
        ventilator support was a challenge. Precious lives were lost in the transit.
        After 25 years of practice- when doctors plan to ‘slow down’ Dr. Mr. and
        Mrs. Bahekar decided to take the challenge of elevating healthcare in
        Gondia to another level. “Gondiacare” was born out of this dream. A
        fully-fledged 10 bedded I.C.U. with state of art ventilators, blood
        distribution unit, neonatal care Centre- Gondiacare was a big boon to the
        locals. <br> <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers of beds were upgraded to 50.
        Another challenge was patients with kidney disease. They had to
        travel to Nagpur thrice weekly for dialysis, a financial and social burden!
        Gondiacare decided to step in and the first dialysis centre of the region
        was set up. Gondiacare hospital has also established its name in Gondia,
        Bhandara, western MP and Chhattisgarh as a centre for high risk
        Obstetrics care.
        Over the years, facilities like laproscopic surgery, neurosurgery,
        urosurgery, joint replacement surgery, monthly visits of super specialists
        including cardiologists, nephrologists, and oncologists were introduced.
        <br> <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empanelment with various public and private insurance companies to
        help the patients was made possible. Monthly camps via the “Kalpataru
        Charitable Trust” have been a regular feature. CMEs and academic
        meetings have been conducted regularly to upgrade the knowledge and
        skills of the medical fraternity in and around Gondia. Well-structured
        internship programmes have been offered for over a decade to the 
        students of the Homeopathy, Ayurvedic and Nursing colleges of the
        district. This has provided the region with qualified and well-trained
        personnel strengthening the healthcare infrastructure.
        In view of the growing epidemic of cardiovascular diseases, we at
        Gondiacare have decided to bring in state of art cardiology services to
        Gondia. Trained in Interventional Cardiology, Dr. Anurag Bahekar is
        planning to provide full time Cardiology consultation at Gondia. Under
        the current comprehensive upgrade, “Bahekar Superspeciality Hospital –
        unit of Gondiacare” will bring in the latest in cardiology to this region.<br> <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        “BSH” will be doing pioneering work in cardiology in the region with
        availability of world-class cathlab services 24* 7. Setting a new
        benchmark, services of angiography, angioplasty, pacemakers and other
        cardiac devices, congenital heart disease management will be brought to
        the region. Cardiovascular surgeries including bypass surgeries and valve
        surgeries will be initiated. A thorough diagnostic set-up for Cardiology
        including head up tilt test, Holter, ambulatory BP evaluation and electrophysiology diagnostic set up is planned.
        Maintaining its legacy in quality obstetrics care, this upgrade will
        include fetal medicine services, minimally invasive services in obstetrics
        & gynecology, painless birthing suites amongst other modern obstetric
        facilities. Dr. Gargee Bahekar, trained in high risk Obstetric care is
        planning to introduce these services at Gondia.
        To cater to the increasing demand, the hospital is going to be
        upgraded to a State of art, modern 75-bedded facility. Most advanced
        cardiac cath-lab, a 32 slice CT scan, a modern world-class obstetric setup, 24*7 canteen services, cardiac health club and rehabilitation services,
        a large auditorium with facilities to conduct CMEs will be a part of this
        comprehensive upgrade. Lead by a team of highly qualified, committed
        consultants and paramedical staff, combined with state-of-art technology,
        BSH aims to bring in seamless healthcare delivery with ease under one
        roof.
        Since its inception over 30 years ago, Bahekar Hospital has been
        honoured by the love and trust of the local people. Acclaimed in the
        region for bringing in the best in healthcare, the latest in technology, at
        affordable costs, “Bahekar Superspeciality Hospital” is marching towards
        another goal of excellence.
